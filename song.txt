"To Hell And Back"

A short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat,
Where bodies lie piled
Hides his emotions,
His blood is running cold
Just like his victories,
His story unfolds
Bright, a white light,
If there'd be,
Any glory in war
Let it rest,
On men like him

Dead men will never come back
